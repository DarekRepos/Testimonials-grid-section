## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

"I learned how to set up and deploy a basic site with Astro, create components, work with data fetching for collections of content, and integrate SCSS with the framework. The most tricky part was styling the component. 

### Continued development

I want to explore more techniques and do more project with Astro.
